Technical mini-books for programmers, easy to understand, learn and apply immediately


## About Coder Book

"Coder Book" is an open-source GitHub organization. Our goal is to create 360 technical mini-books, helping programmers (Coders) learn and master various technical knowledge in the simplest and most understandable way.

Whether it's programming basics, framework usage, tool tips, or underlying principles, we aim to make complex technologies clear and straightforward through the "mini-book" format. Each book focuses on a specific knowledge point, is concise in length, and has a low reading threshold, allowing you to quickly absorb it using fragmented time.

Let's spread technical knowledge in a simple way together!
